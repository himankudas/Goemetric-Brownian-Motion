# Geometric Brownian Motion

## Discription  
This repository represents a simulation of Geometric Brownian Motion.

We will need the following Libraries that will need to be imported.

1. pandas
2. numpy
3. datetime
4. pandas_datareader
5. scipy
6. matplotlib
7. math
8. yfinance


This program is implemented in [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/). 

### Introduction:

A Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) (also known as exponential Brownian motion) is a continuous-time stochastic process in which the logarithm of the randomly varying quantity follows a Brownian motion (also called a Wiener process) with drift.

The python code in this repository is a example of the Geometric Brownian Motion using the Bank Nifty data as an example.
